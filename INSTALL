# INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
###########################################################################

WEB RESOURCES
  JS-App is made up of JavaScript files (.js), Cascading Style Sheet
  files (.css), and image files (.png/.jpg/.gif).  With these, you
  can build a complete client-side application in JavaScript.
  These need to be installed somewhere under your web server's
  document root (i.e. "htdocs").

CGI PROGRAMS
  In order to enable your applications to be full web applications
  (accessing functions on the server), a few perl programs are 
  provided.  These are (working) example programs that essentially
  provide web services to the JavaScript application. Their functionality
  can be reimplemented in any language, thus making the js-app framework
  not necessarily dependent on perl.  To use these perl programs, they
  need to be installed in a directory which your web server recognizes
  as containing CGI programs (i.e. "cgi-bin").

UTILITY PROGRAMS
  Other tools (such as theme-generation, theme-manipulation, and image
  manipulation tools) are written in perl.  These tools are not necessary
  for the successful running of the application.  They are useful for 
  development.  They need to be installed in a directory which is in your
  PATH so that these programs can be executed (i.e. "bin").

NOTES:
  * A variety of files exist in the base directory of this distribution
    which are used by the perl installation tool, Module::Build.
    Other files exist for regression testing or documentation.
    They are not needed for use of the

# PERL-BASED INSTALLATION
###########################################################################

Make sure you have "Module::Build" and "App::Build" installed.
If not (or to make sure), as root, type:

   perl -MCPAN -e "install Module::Build"
   perl -MCPAN -e "install App::Build"

This distribution can be installed from CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network) with the following command.

   perl -MCPAN -e "install js-app"

However, because you are reading this README, it is likely you have
downloaded the distribution yourself (perhaps because you have a version
more recent than that which is on CPAN or you got it from CVS).

In that case, to install this module, cd to the directory that contains
this README file and type the following.

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test     #(optional)
   perl Build install
